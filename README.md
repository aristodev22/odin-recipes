This is a project submission from TOP. In this project, I practiced creating pages, linking them to each other, heading tags, lists, images and links.

# UPDATE 28/08/2022
Added styles via an external CSS file, without using Flexbox.

# TO DO LIST
1. Remake the layout with Flebox
2. Remake the website with Tailwind CSS
3. Remake the website in React
