            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This crustless quiche made with eggs, spinach, and Muenster cheese is perfect to serve at any meal. With
                no heavy crust to make, this light-tasting quiche is ready in under an hour. Make it your own by adding
                leftover ham and substituting Cheddar, feta, or goat cheese for the Muenster. I serve this quick and
                easy quiche in the summer for brunch with a side of sausage links and a fresh fruit bowl!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry</li>
                <li>5 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>3 cups shredded Muenster cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch pie pan.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until
                    soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in spinach and continue to cook until excess moisture has evaporated.
                </li>
                <li>Whisk together eggs, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add Muenster cheese and spinach mixture and
                    stir until well blended. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs have set, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
